## Test Strategy:

### Process of Testing:
   - Define objectives and goals of testing:
   - Identify testing requirements and constraints.
   - Plan test activities, resources, and timelines.
   - Design test cases and test scenarios.
   - Execute tests.
   - Report and manage defects.
   - Evaluate test results and provide feedback.

### Testing Levels:
- Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules.
- Integration Testing: Testing the interaction between integrated components/modules.
- System Testing: Testing the entire system as a whole.
- Acceptance Testing: Testing whether the system meets the requirements and is accepted by stakeholders.
- Regression Testing: Testing to ensure that new changes have not adversely affected existing functionalities.

### Roles and Responsibilities of Each Team Member:
- Test Manager: Overall responsible for the testing process, including planning, resource management, and reporting.
- Test Lead: Leads the testing team, assigns tasks, and coordinates testing activities.
- Testers: Execute test cases, report defects, and provide feedback.
- Developers: Provide support for debugging and fixing defects.
- Business Analysts: Provide requirements and validate acceptance criteria.
- Product Owners/Stakeholders: Define acceptance criteria and approve final deliverables.

## Types of Testing:
- Load Testing: Evaluates system behavior under specific load conditions to ensure scalability.
- Performance Testing: Measures system performance under different scenarios to meet performance requirements.
- Integration Testing: Verifies the interaction between integrated components/modules.
- System Testing: Tests the entire system against specified requirements.
- Acceptance Testing: Validates whether the system meets acceptance criteria and is ready for deployment.
- Regression Testing: Ensures that new changes do not adversely affect existing functionalities.

## Testing Approach & Automation Tool:
- Testing Approach: Agile, Waterfall, DevOps, etc., depending on the project methodology.
- Automation Tool: Selenium, JUnit, TestNG, Cucumber, etc., based on the technology stack and testing requirements.

## Regression Testing and Test Sign-off:
- Regression Testing: Re-running test cases to ensure that new changes haven't introduced any defects or regressions.
- Test Sign-off: Formal approval from stakeholders indicating that testing is complete, and the system is ready for deployment.
